# GenieClaw Repository Architecture

GenieClaw is the agent layer of the broader Genie ecosystem.

This repository should be understood as the Rust agent runtime that sits above:

- custom Jetson hardware
- GenieOS, the custom L4T and system image layer
- `genie-voice-runtime`, the external voice runtime for wake/VAD/STT/TTS/audio
- `genie-home-runtime`, the future AI-native home automation runtime
- `genie-ai-runtime`, the future Jetson-only LLM inference runtime

It sits below:

- web apps
- mobile apps
- installer/operator tools
- future household and developer-facing product surfaces

The purpose of this repo is to make the local home AI useful, private, safe, and understandable. It should not grow into the OS, the full home automation engine, the CUDA inference runtime, or the product app.

The architectural invariant is now enforced in code as well as docs:

- `genie_core::runtime_boundary` names the AI, voice, and home runtime owners.
- `genie_core::agent_harness` validates prompt, tool, memory, response reserve,
  and optional-provider context against the Jetson 4096-token baseline.
- `[agent]` selects the deployment profile while keeping `jetson` as the
  flagship default.
- `[optional_ai_provider]` is opt-in and cannot become a production candidate
  unless it remains limited-context compatible.

## What This Repo Owns

GenieClaw owns the human-facing intelligence loop:

- spoken response behavior and voice-session policy
- prompt construction and reasoning-mode selection
- memory capture, policy, recall, and dashboard management
- skill and tool routing
- conversation history
- query rejection for shared-room audio
- channel adapters such as web chat, REPL, CLI, Telegram, and future app channels
- high-level action intent before handoff to the home runtime
- local confirmation UX for risky physical actions

The repo should optimize for repeated daily usefulness:

- remember useful household context
- answer and act quickly on Jetson-class hardware
- control the home through a bounded runtime contract
- explain what happened
- work when the internet is down

## What This Repo Should Not Own Long Term

These responsibilities belong in lower or upper layers:

- Jetson board support, kernel/device-tree work, OTA base image ownership: `genie-os`
- Matter/Thread/Zigbee/BLE device graph and automation engine: `genie-home-runtime`
- final physical actuation safety checks: `genie-home-runtime`
- llama.cpp fork, CUDA kernels, model memory planner: `genie-ai-runtime`
- wake word, VAD, STT, TTS, ALSA/audio-device handling, denoise, and AEC: `genie-voice-runtime`
- full product app, account UX, mobile push, installer workflows: application layer

This repo can keep transitional implementations while those layers are still forming, but the code should be structured so those boundaries can be replaced by stable clients.

## Current Transitional Adapters

The current repo still contains pragmatic adapters used to ship on Jetson now.

| Current adapter | Long-term replacement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `genie-ai-runtime` OpenAI-compatible client (default on Jetson) | `llama.cpp` client (selectable fallback) | Both backends ship behind the `LlmClient` facade; per-deployment selection via `[services.llm].backend` in `geniepod.toml`. Backend identity surfaces in `/api/health`, startup logs, and `genie-ctl status`. |
| In-repo voice pipeline under `crates/genie-core/src/voice/` and `voice_loop.rs` | [`genie-voice-runtime`](https://github.com/GeniePod/genie-voice-runtime) | Keep current code as a transitional Jetson bring-up path. New wake/VAD/STT/TTS/audio ownership should move to the external runtime. GenieClaw should consume transcripts and issue speak commands. |
| Home Assistant provider | `genie-home-runtime` MCP/API client | Keep HA-specific behavior behind `ha/` and tools/home boundaries. |
| Actuation safety in `genie-core` | final safety in `genie-home-runtime` | Keep current safety as an agent-side guard and confirmation layer. |
| `genie-api` dashboard | application layer | Keep it operational and lightweight; avoid making it the long-term product app. |
| `genie-governor` service lifecycle | GenieOS/system supervisor | Keep it useful for Jetson bring-up while OS ownership matures. |
| ESP32-C6 UART boundary | GenieOS connectivity service | Agent sees health/capabilities, not raw radio/device-driver internals. |

## Desired Internal Shape

The repo should trend toward these conceptual modules, even if existing file names remain for now.

| Conceptual area | Current code |
| --- | --- |
| Agent orchestration | `crates/genie-core/src/server.rs`, `repl.rs`, `voice_loop.rs`, `reasoning.rs`, `prompt.rs` |
| AI runtime client | `crates/genie-core/src/llm/` |
| Home runtime client | `crates/genie-core/src/ha/`, `tools/home.rs` |
| Voice runtime client | transitional `crates/genie-core/src/voice/`, `voice_loop.rs`; target external client for `genie-voice-runtime` |
| Memory system | `crates/genie-core/src/memory/`, `conversation.rs` |
| Tool and skill routing | `crates/genie-core/src/tools/`, `skills/` |
| Channel adapters | `server.rs`, `repl.rs`, `telegram.rs`, `genie-ctl` |
| Runtime policy | `security/`, `memory/policy.rs`, `tools/actuation.rs`, `ha/policy.rs` |
| Operations | `genie-api`, `genie-health`, `genie-governor`, deploy assets |

The important rule is dependency direction:

```text
channels -> agent orchestration -> memory/tools/skills
tools -> runtime clients
runtime clients -> lower runtimes or transitional external systems
```

Code in memory, voice, prompt, and channels should not learn Home Assistant internals. Code in agent orchestration should not learn model-server implementation details beyond the `LlmClient` contract.

Voice code has one additional rule: GenieClaw may own spoken agent behavior,
but it should not own the long-term audio pipeline. Wake word, VAD, STT, TTS,
audio-device handling, denoise, AEC, and streaming voice events belong in
`genie-voice-runtime`.

## Process Topology Today

Current Jetson deployment:

```text
LLM backend (:8080)         # genie-ai-runtime by default on Jetson;
                            # fallback: [services.llm].backend = "llama_cpp"
        ^
        |
genie-core (:3000) <---- genie-ctl
        |
        +---- local chat UI / OpenAI-compatible clients
        +---- optional Telegram adapter
        +---- optional Home Assistant provider
        +---- optional ESP32-C6 connectivity controller boundary

genie-api      ---- dashboard/status service
genie-governor ---- pressure response and service lifecycle
genie-health   ---- health polling and history
```

Target deployment:

```text
genie-ai-runtime
        ^
        |
genie-voice-runtime ---- transcript/speak events
        ^                         |
        |                         v

        |
        +---- web/mobile apps
        +---- skills and channels
        v
genie-home-runtime
        |
        v
GenieOS + hardware
```

## Safety Ownership

GenieClaw must treat physical actuation as high-risk.

Current safety responsibilities in this repo:

- recognize risky home actions
- apply origin-specific restrictions
- create local confirmation tokens
- expose pending confirmations to dashboard/API
- write actuation audit events
- avoid relying on the model prompt as a safety boundary

Long-term safety responsibilities in `genie-home-runtime`:

- final deterministic actuation checks
- device availability and state checks
- automation policy
- scene and multi-device safety rules
- replayable action logs
- recovery and rollback behavior

The agent may propose or request actions. The home runtime decides whether physical execution is allowed.

## Portable Profiles

GenieClaw supports portable development without changing the native product
shape. `[agent].runtime_profile` describes where the same agent harness is
running:

| Profile | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `jetson` | Flagship GeniePod Home path; 4096-token baseline and local runtime default |
| `raspberry_pi` | SBC development profile for headless agent and provider work |
| `portable_sbc` | Generic SBC profile where voice/home runtimes may be absent |
| `laptop` | Developer profile for local tests, docs, and provider integration |
| `mac` | macOS developer profile; no Jetson-specific runtime assumptions |

Profiles do not change ownership. They only make the same limited-context agent
contract portable enough for development and review on non-Jetson hardware.

## Optional Providers

API-key AI providers are optional provider boundaries, not the default product
runtime. They must satisfy all of these before being treated as production
paths:

- configured under `[optional_ai_provider]`, disabled by default
- API key comes from an environment variable, not the TOML value itself
- `context_window_tokens <= [agent].context_window_tokens`
- remote endpoints require `allow_remote_base_url = true`
- prompt/tool/memory budget passes `genie_core::agent_harness`

The flagship path remains local `genie-ai-runtime` on Jetson. Optional providers
exist to make development, CI, and non-Jetson deployments easier without
weakening the limited-context home-agent contract.

## Memory Ownership

GenieClaw owns household memory because memory is part of the agent experience.

The memory system must stay:

- local by default
- policy-aware for shared-room use
- editable by the user
- auditable through canonical artifacts
- independent from any specific LLM backend

The application layer can expose memory management UI, but memory writes should go through GenieClaw APIs so policy metadata, event logs, and durable memory files stay consistent.

## Skill Ownership

GenieClaw owns skill routing and the skill ABI.

Skills should be:

- permissioned
- auditable
- removable
- testable locally
- isolated from lower runtime internals unless explicitly granted

Skills should call stable GenieClaw or home-runtime interfaces. They should not reach directly into Home Assistant, CUDA runtime details, or OS-level radio drivers.

## Naming Guidance

This repo is strategically `genie-claw`, even though some crate and service names still use `genie-core`.

Short-term rule:

- do not rename crates just for branding
- use docs and boundaries to clarify ownership first
- rename only when the lower runtimes and app layer boundaries are stable enough to avoid churn

Long-term direction:

- `genie-claw`: agent layer repository and product brain
- `genie-voice-runtime`: voice I/O runtime for wake, VAD, STT, TTS, and audio streaming
- `genie-home-runtime`: home automation and physical actuation runtime
- `genie-ai-runtime`: Jetson-only inference runtime
- `genie-os`: custom L4T image and hardware bring-up layer

## Refactor Direction

The clean architecture path is incremental:

1. Make boundary language consistent in docs and config.
2. Keep Home Assistant and LLM backends behind narrow adapter traits (LLM side resolved via the `LlmClient` facade in `crates/genie-core/src/llm/`).
3. Move physical actuation authority downward into `genie-home-runtime` when it exists.
4. Move Jetson model-server specialization downward into `genie-ai-runtime`.
5. Move voice/audio pipeline ownership downward into `genie-voice-runtime`.
6. Keep GenieClaw focused on agent policy, memory, skills, tools, channels, and household interaction.

This prevents the agent repo from becoming a single large mixed runtime while still allowing today’s Jetson appliance to keep working.
